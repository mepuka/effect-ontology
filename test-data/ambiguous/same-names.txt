The International AI Conference featured two researchers named Dr. Sarah Chen.

Dr. Sarah Chen from Google Research specializes in natural language processing and machine translation. She has been at Google for eight years and leads a team of fifteen researchers. Her work on multilingual models has been widely cited. She can be reached at sarah.chen@google.com and maintains her publications at https://research.google/people/sarah-chen.

Dr. Sarah Chen from MIT is a professor of computer science focusing on knowledge representation and reasoning. She has been at MIT for twelve years and has supervised over twenty PhD students. Her work on semantic web technologies is foundational to the field. She can be reached at sarah.chen@mit.edu and maintains her research page at https://csail.mit.edu/~schen.

At the conference, both Sarah Chens were scheduled to speak on the same day. Google's Sarah Chen presented "Scaling Language Models for Global Communication" in the morning session. MIT's Sarah Chen presented "Ontological Foundations for AI Systems" in the afternoon session.

The conference organizers initially confused the two researchers when preparing the program. They had to clarify which Sarah Chen would be presenting in which session and ensure the correct affiliations were listed.

During the networking session, the two Sarah Chens finally met in person. Google's Sarah mentioned she had read MIT Sarah's paper on knowledge graphs. MIT's Sarah responded that she was impressed by Google Sarah's work on translation models.

They discovered they had a mutual colleague, Dr. James Wilson, who had collaborated with both of them on separate projects. James had worked with Google's Sarah on a language understanding project and with MIT's Sarah on a semantic reasoning system.

The two decided to explore a joint project combining their expertise. Google's Sarah would contribute the language understanding capabilities, while MIT's Sarah would provide the knowledge representation framework. They exchanged direct contact information to bypass any future confusion:

Google's Sarah: sarah.chen.nlp@google.com (alternate email for collaborations)
MIT's Sarah: schen-research@mit.edu (alternate email for collaborations)

Their collaboration resulted in a paper published the following year titled "Grounding Language Models in Structured Knowledge" which cited both researchers' previous work.
