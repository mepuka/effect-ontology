Alice met Bob at the AI conference in San Francisco last month. She found him very knowledgeable about semantic web technologies and knowledge graphs. He mentioned that his colleague Carol was also attending the same conference.

When they met her the next day, she was presenting a paper on ontology engineering. The paper was titled "Modern Approaches to Ontology Design" and it received excellent reviews. She had co-authored it with her supervisor, Dr. James Wilson.

After the presentation, he approached her to discuss potential collaboration opportunities. They exchanged contact information and agreed to set up a follow-up meeting. She gave him her email address, carol@techuniversity.edu, and he shared his, bob.smith@datacompany.io.

Alice, who had been observing this exchange, joined their conversation. She suggested they all meet for coffee to discuss their shared interests. They agreed and scheduled a meeting for the following week.

During the coffee meeting, she proposed creating a joint research project. He was enthusiastic about the idea, and she agreed to coordinate with her institution. They decided to call the project "Knowledge Graph Integration Initiative."

The three researchers formed a strong collaboration. She contributed her expertise in ontologies, he brought knowledge of large-scale systems, and she connected them with industry partners. Their first joint paper was published six months later.
