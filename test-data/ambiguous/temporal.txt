Bob Johnson's career has spanned multiple companies over the past decade.

From 2015 to 2018, Bob worked at StartupA Inc as a software engineer. During this time, his email was bob.johnson@startupa.com and he maintained a personal blog at https://bob-at-startupa.com. He developed their initial product architecture and led a team of three engineers.

In 2018, Bob joined MidCorp Technologies as a senior engineer. His email changed to bob.johnson@midcorp.io. He worked on their data platform, redesigning the entire system to handle increased scale. His profile was at https://midcorp.io/team/bob-johnson.

Bob stayed at MidCorp until 2021 when he was recruited by BigTech Corporation. His new email became bob.j@bigtech.com and his corporate page is https://bigtech.com/people/bjohnson. He was promoted to Principal Engineer within his first year.

Throughout these changes, Bob maintained relationships with several colleagues:

Alice Chen knew Bob from StartupA, where they worked together. When Bob moved to MidCorp, Alice stayed at StartupA as CTO. They kept in touch through Bob's personal email, bobjohnson.personal@gmail.com.

Carol Smith met Bob at MidCorp, where she was his manager. When Bob left for BigTech, Carol wished him well but they lost touch for a while. Carol is now at DifferentCorp with email carol.smith@differentcorp.com.

David Park has known Bob since their university days at Stanford. David has always worked at Google, at david.park@google.com. He introduced Bob to the hiring manager at BigTech, helping Bob get his current position.

Currently, Bob reports to Emily Watson at BigTech. Emily is the VP of Engineering and can be reached at emily.watson@bigtech.com. She joined BigTech in 2019 and has been Bob's manager since he arrived.

Bob's LinkedIn shows his complete history: https://linkedin.com/in/bob-johnson-engineer. His personal website, https://bobjohnson.dev, has remained constant through all his career changes, though the content has evolved to reflect his current role and interests.

As of 2024, Bob is considering his next move. He has been approached by both a promising startup and another large tech company. His decision will likely depend on the opportunities for technical leadership and impact.
